# emotion-based-music-recommendation-system
 Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System implemented in Python using Tkinter for GUI, OpenCV for face detection, Keras for emotion recognition, and Pygame for audio playback. The system allows users to upload an image containing faces, detects emotions from those faces, and recommends music based on the predominant emotion detected. The system utilizes a pre-trained Haar Cascade classifier for face detection and a deep learning model for emotion recognition. Upon image upload, the system processes the image to detect faces and extract facial regions. The extracted faces are then passed through the emotion recognition model to determine the dominant emotion. The emotion categories include "angry," "disgust," "scared," "happy," "sad," "surprised," and "neutral." Based on the detected emotion, the system recommends music corresponding to the emotional state. For instance, "Happy" music is recommended for joyful expressions, "Sad" music for expressions of sadness, and a default music track for other emotions.
