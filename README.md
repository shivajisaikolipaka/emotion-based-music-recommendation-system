**# Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System**  

## ðŸ“œ Project Description  
The Emotion-Based Music Recommendation System is an interactive Python application that combines emotion recognition with music recommendation. Using advanced tools like OpenCV for face detection, Keras for emotion recognition, and Tkinter for a user-friendly interface, the system allows users to upload an image with faces, analyzes the emotional state of the faces, and recommends music tailored to the detected emotions. This project bridges the gap between artificial intelligence and user experience by creating a personalized music recommendation based on emotional cues.

## âœ¨ Key Features  
- **Image Upload**: Users can upload images containing one or more faces.  
- **Emotion Detection**: Detects emotions such as *angry, disgust, scared, happy, sad, surprised,* and *neutral* using a deep learning model.  
- **Face Detection**: Uses the Haar Cascade classifier for identifying faces in the uploaded image.  
- **Music Recommendation**: Recommends music tracks aligned with the detected emotions:  
  - *Happy* â†’ Uplifting music  
  - *Sad* â†’ Melancholic music  
  - *Neutral* â†’ Default tracks  
- **Audio Playback**: Plays the recommended music using the Pygame library.  
- **Intuitive GUI**: Designed with Tkinter for a seamless user experience.
